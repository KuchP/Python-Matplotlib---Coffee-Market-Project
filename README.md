# Python: Seaborn - Car Market Analysis

Thanks to the Maven Analytics course, now I feel more confident in my ability to create custom and dynamic visualizations that will help me effectively communicate insights and findings to my colleagues and stakeholders.

This project was a great way to reinforce my learning and build my confidence in my ability to create compelling visualizations that effectively communicate complex data. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress I have made and look forward to continuing to develop my skills in this exciting field.

### Data Analysis points:

_Problem statement:_ 

I am seeking detailed information on the global coffee market, including current trends, major players, and pricing dynamics, to identify new opportunities in this rapidly growing industry.

### Data pre-processing:
This section describes the pre-processing steps that were applied to the dataset used in this project. The dataset was initially set up without any missing values (NAs) present. However, some small pre-processing was still required to prepare the data for analysis.

The pre-processing steps that were applied to the dataset include (but are not limited to):

    Data transformation: converting data into a suitable format for analysis

The resulting pre-processed dataset was then used for further analysis in this project.

Please refer to the relevant code files in this repository for more detailed information about the specific pre-processing steps applied to the dataset.

### Results and findings

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize data on coffee production and consumption. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following:

    Visualize the top 10 producers of coffee in the world.
    Compare the top 5 coffee producers over time, year by year.
    Compare Brazil's coffee production with the rest of the world.
    Conduct a regression analysis comparing Brazil's coffee production with that of Venezuela and Vietnam.
    Compare the percentage of coffee production between the top 5 producing countries and the rest of the world.
    Examine the differences between coffee consumption and prices.
    Present all findings in a gridspec.
